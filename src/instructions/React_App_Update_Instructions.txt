1. Make Changes in Local Environment
    - Edit your code files locally, making whatever changes you need. This can include modifying existing files or adding new ones.

2. Test Locally
    - Run your app locally to make sure everything works as expected. You can typically do this using:
    ```
    npm start
    ```
    or
    ```
    yarn start

2.5 Build the project

npm run build
    ```

3. Commit Changes
    - Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit them to your local repository.
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Description of changes made"
    ```

3.5 Check what branch you are in:
	
    git branch

4. Push to Main Branch (or whichever branch you are working on)
    - Push these changes to the main branch (or whatever branch you are using for development) of your GitHub repository.
    ```
    git push origin main
    ```

5. Deploy to GitHub Pages
    - Run the deploy script that you have set up in your package.json. This will build your project and push it to the gh-pages branch, which is what GitHub Pages uses for your live site.
    ```
    npm run deploy
    ```
    or
    ```
    yarn deploy
    ```

6. Verify Changes
    - After the deploy script completes, your changes should be live on GitHub Pages. It may take a few minutes for the changes to propagate. Visit your GitHub Pages URL to verify that the changes are live and working as expected.
